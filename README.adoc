# amicontained-build

- This repo is experimental.
- It aims to build ARM64 containers for https://github.com/genuinetools/amicontained/[amicontained]
- Due to https://github.com/genuinetools/amicontained/pull/15/commits[adding the checking seccomp filter function], the arm64 build is not working for the offical repo >=0.46.
This repo reverted the comment so the checking of blocked seccomp function does not work.
- Use it at your own risk.
